# Icon Placeholders

You need to create two icon files:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be your app's logo/icon. You can:
1. Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Create them in a graphics editor
3. Use a simple icon generator

For now, you can use any square PNG image and rename it, or create simple colored squares as placeholders.
